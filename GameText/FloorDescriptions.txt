Forest
A vast forest expands out and reaches as far as the eye can see. 
There is a small dirt trail that leads deep into the forest.
It seems like this is the only path forward.
~Sea
A deep sea refracts light and illuminates the cavern. 
The shine of the water gives off a relaxing feeling that contrasts the difficult battles that lie ahead.
~Canyon
Dry rocks and dust blow in the wind across gigantic cliff faces.
It is a beautiful yet harsh landscape. 
The way forward is uncertain.
~Storm
Wind and rain furiously beat down upon the land. 
The storm shows no sign of subsiding. It seems to have been going on for a while.
While the ferocity of the storm seems genuine, something about it's duration feels artifical.
Is there a key to ending the storm hidden somewhere in the floor?
~Desert
Nothing but sand fills one's vision on this floor. The heat relentlessly beats down upon those who enter.
Venturing through this floor will definitely take its toll on travelers.
